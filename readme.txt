the structure of the code ive apploaded is this


'hn' follows the name of this repo......'help needed'

views.py file ==== 'hn_views.py'

urls.py file ==== 'hn_urls.py'

the dashboard.html file 
and the files its including ie basic_stats.html & barchart.html

Notice that in the views ive included what id like those views to return yet some ive not yet created the templates
say for the tables and some of the piecharts

But the idea is that if i can manage to pull of a single template hn_dashboard.html' displaying data from multiple views, i'll have gotten the idea of how to go about the rest.

I thank whoever is taking time to read this and help.
